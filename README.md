# CustomBottomTabNavigator
This is a modification to the repo 10clouds/FluidBottomNavigation-rn

This is a working version with react-navigation v5 

It is modified to work with initalRouteName, triggering the animation when the app starts

Moreover, instead of working with png, now its able to work with react-native-vector-icons.

By defaul, its working with AntDesign icons, but if you wish to change the icons to others change the file in components/TabBar. You just need to change the import of the icons
